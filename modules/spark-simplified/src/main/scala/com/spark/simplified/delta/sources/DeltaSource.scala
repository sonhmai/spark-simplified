/**
 * A streaming source for a Delta table.
 *
 * When a new stream is started, delta starts by constructing a
 * [[org.apache.spark.sql.delta.Snapshot]] at
 * the current version of the table. This snapshot is broken up into batches until
 * all existing data has been processed. Subsequent processing is done by tailing
 * the change log looking for new data. This results in the streaming query returning
 * the same answer as a batch query that had processed the entire dataset at any given point.
