/**
 * Implemented by objects that produce relations for a specific kind of data source.  When
 * Spark SQL is given a DDL operation with a USING clause specified (to specify the implemented
 * RelationProvider), this interface is used to pass in the parameters specified by a user.
 *
 * Users may specify the fully qualified class name of a given data source.  When that class is
 * not found Spark SQL will append the class name `DefaultSource` to the path, allowing for
 * less verbose invocation.  For example, 'org.apache.spark.sql.json' would resolve to the
 * data source 'org.apache.spark.sql.json.DefaultSource'
 *
 * A new instance of this class will be instantiated each time a DDL call is made.
 *
 * @since 1.3.0
